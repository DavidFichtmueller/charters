# Charter of the TDWG Infrastructure Functional Subcommittee (`infrastructure`)

## Mission

The purpose of the Infrastructure Functional Subcommittee (FC) is to maintain the software tools required to support the operation of TDWG.

TDWG is an open community and participants require the means to discuss, coordinate, document, vote on, and version the development of biodiversity data standards. The TDWG organization needs the means to present and communicate its work, manage financial matters and run the annual conference. The FS exists to advise the executive committee and membership on software solutions to achieve these goals, to assist in developing and documenting information processes, and to oversee implementation and maintenance of the selected tools.

## Responsibilities

### Scope

To oversee the operation and coordinate the development of the software tools in use by TDWG including:

1. TDWG website development, hosting, DNS, operating system upgrades, intrusion detection, etc. 
1. Versioning, collaborative development, archival and distribution mechanism for standards (i.e. the use of GitHub)
1. Tools to support collaborative documentation authoring
1. Communication and discussion tools such as mailing lists, wikis, Slack.com, etc.

The FS will coordinate and lead the technical helpdesk which supports the TDWG committees, interest- and working groups in the full lifecycle of their work. This includes advice on establishing communication channels, guidelines for documenting and discussing results, preparation for community voting, archival and publication of results, cleanup.

### Oversight of implementation

The FS will evaluate potential software tools of interest to TDWG and provide recommendations to the community and for decision by the executive committee. Once approved, the infrastructure FS will be tasked with overseeing the implementation of these software tools, including the management of related sub-contracted work.
